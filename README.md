# Path of Rust

## Introduction

'Path of Rust' is a third-party application designed for the game Path of Exile, which provides a visually satisfying interface enabling players to strategically plan their character builds. This application focuses on visualization and planning around the game's vast and complex skill tree. Please note that while Path of Rust draws inspiration from the community project, Path of Building, it has no affiliation with the aforementioned project or Grinding Gear Games, the creator of Path of Exile. If you actually want to make a build, it is recommended to use [Path of Building](https://pathofbuilding.community/) instead.

At its core, this project is a platform for the developer to hone and deepen their understanding of Rust. While benefiting from the application is a hope, do understand that its primary objective is to stimulate individual growth and learning.

## Technologies Used

This project has been made possible by implementing a blend of contemporary technologies:

- The front end is built using [React](https://react.dev/), which offers an interactive UI.
- The UI layout has been created using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), delivering a utility-first CSS framework that is not only well-designed but also flexible.
- The back end is powered by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), ensuring a reliable and fast service layer.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is employed as a bridge between front-end and back-end, providing a fluid, lightweight, and secure desktop application.
